# Time-series-Models
Time-series Models with popular statistical models like VAR, ARMA
# Key steps
Data Import and Preprocessing:
Loading time series data
Handling missing values
Resampling or aggregating data if necessary
Exploratory Data Analysis:
Visualizing the time series
Checking for seasonality, trends, and stationarity
Performing statistical tests (e.g., Augmented Dickey-Fuller test for stationarity)
Feature Engineering:
Creating lag features
Extracting date-based features (e.g., day of week, month, year)
Model Implementation:
Implementing various time series models such as ARIMA, SARIMA, or Prophet
Using machine learning models like Random Forest or LSTM for time series forecasting
Model Evaluation:
Splitting data into train and test sets
Evaluating model performance using metrics like MAE, RMSE, or MAPE
Comparing different models
